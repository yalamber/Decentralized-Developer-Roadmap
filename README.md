## Roadmap to become a Decentralized Developer

A personal roadmap to become a decentralized developer

### What's decentralization?

From wikipedia: 
"**Decentralization or decentralisation** is the process by which the activities of an organization, particularly those regarding planning and decision making, are distributed or delegated away from a central, authoritative location or group."

"**Decentralized computing** is a decentralised system that allocated resources, both hardware and software, to each individual workstation, or office location. In contrast, centralized computing exists when the majority of functions are carried out, or obtained from a remote centralized location."

### Is internet decentralized?
Internet is the biggest decentralized network in our human history, But most of the services we use for most of the tasks these days on internet seems to be centralized by specific organizations.
